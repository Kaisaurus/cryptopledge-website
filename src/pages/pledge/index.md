## How much emissions have I generated by using cryptocurrencies?

For every Bitcoin transaction you make, it is estimated you cause over 3.5 tonnes of CO2e to be generated.

## How can I compensate for the emissions Iâ€™ve generated by using cryptocurrencies?

By donating to effective carbon offsetting organizations!

E.g. for every Bitcoin transaction you make, donate 0.35 euro to an organization that can offset 1 tonne of emissions per euro.
