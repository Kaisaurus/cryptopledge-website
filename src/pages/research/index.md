Our suggested donations are based on Digiconomist’s [Bitcoin](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)* and [Ethereum](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption) Energy Consumption Index and carbon footprint [estimates](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-carbon-footprint).

The index approaches the problem of how much energy a cryptocurrency network consumes from an economic perspective: in essence, the more money miners earn, the more computers can be supported and the more energy will be consumed. In economic terms: the marginal cost (electricity) will adapt to the marginal benefit (price). Based on data about how much revenue is being made from Bitcoin mining, the index estimates how much energy the network is consuming.

From this, an estimate of the carbon footprint per Bitcoin and Ethereum transaction is calculated using an emission factor based on an assumption of the proportion of the network estimated to be powered by coal-fueled electricity, as well as using published data about the operations of a working Bitcoin mine in China. The Ethereum network energy use is assumed to be different due to the lack of specialised mining hardware.

We combine Digiconomist’s value of carbon footprint per Bitcoin transaction with estimates provided by various organizations of how much CO2e they can compensate per dollar, bitcoin or ethereum donated to them, to arrive at suggested donations per Bitcoin transaction.

**Example**

Digiconomist estimates that in a certain period, a Bitcoin transaction generates over 3.5 tonnes of CO2e. So, for every Bitcoin transaction you make, we suggest you donate 3.5 euro to an organization that can offset 1 tonne of CO2e per euro.

Think you can extend or update our estimates? [Let us know!](https://github.com/Kaisaurus/cryptopledge-website) 

\*Note, just like Digiconomist we combine the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash networks

## Other currencies

We can divide all other cryptocurrencies in three groups:

1. ERC20 tokens

Take up a percentage of the Ethereum network! Is your team behind the creation of such a token, let us know and discuss the opportunity to offset your carbon emissions.

2. Energy friendly cryptocurrencies 

Consensus protocols have been around for decades. Note that more energy-efficient alternatives to Proof of Work are all more centralized or likely to be unfair.

* Ripple
* Stellar
* NEO
* Cardano
* IOTA
* NEM
* Tron
* Tether

3. Still to analyse

The 10 largest cryptocurrencies cost many orders of magnitude more energy than other cryptocurrencies. With your help, we can include analyses for more currencies. On the top of our todo list are:

* Litecoin
* Monero
* Dash
* Ethereum Classic
