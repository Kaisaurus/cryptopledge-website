Our suggested donations are based on Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index\[x] and Bitcoin carbon footprint estimate\[y].



The index approaches the problem of how much energy a cryptocurrency network consumes from an economic perspective: in essence, the more money miners earn, the more computers can be supported and the more energy will be consumed. So, from data about how much revenue is being made from Bitcoin mining, the index estimates how much energy the network is consuming.

Combining this with data about how many transactions are performed by the network\[z] gives the index’s estimate of energy consumed per transaction.

From this, an estimate of the carbon footprint per Bitcoin transaction is calculated using an emission factor based on a proportion of the network estimated to be powered by coal-fueled electricity and published data about the operations of a working Bitcoin mine in China\[a].

We combine Digiconomist’s value of carbon footprint per Bitcoin transaction with estimates provided by various organizations of how much CO2e they compensate for per unit of currency (crypto or otherwise) donated to them, to arrive at suggested donations per Bitcoin transaction as follows.

Digiconomist estimates that each Bitcoin transactions generates over 3.5 tonnes of CO2e

So, for every Bitcoin transaction you make, we suggest you donate 0.35 euro to an organization that can offset 1 tonne of CO2e per euro.



## Other currencies

Digiconomist does not provide an estimate of the carbon footprint per transaction for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, because equivalent data on the operations of mines for those currencies is not available.

He does however provide the Ethereum Energy Consumption Index\[b], using the same economic approach as the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index.

Therefore, we suggest the same donations per Ethereum transaction as per Bitcoin transaction, andcombine the Bitcoin carbon footprint per transaction estimate with his estimates of the energy consumed by the Ethereum network, to arrive at an estimate of the total emissions produced by the Ethereum network and the donations still needed to offset that total.



## Carbon offsetting estimates

Do you have reason to believe any of the estimates we’re using are wrong or could be improved?
